# 📊 **Data Cleaning and Integration Project** 📊

Welcome to the **Data Cleaning and Integration Project** repository! This project showcases my expertise in SQL, data cleaning, and database management. Here, I’ve worked with multiple tables, performed complex joins, and created dynamic views to streamline data analysis and reporting. Dive in to explore how I’ve transformed raw data into actionable insights!

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning, integrating, and analyzing data from multiple tables in a relational database. The goal was to create a unified and structured dataset that can be used for reporting, analysis, and decision-making. By leveraging SQL queries and views, I’ve simplified complex data relationships and made the data more accessible for end-users.

## 💡 **Key Features**

- **Data Cleaning**: Performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- **Complex Joins**: Combined data from multiple tables (`orders`, `customer`, `order_item`, `products`, `customer_feedbacks`, `delivery`, `rating`, and `category`) using SQL joins.
- **Dynamic Views**: Created SQL views (`zeptodb` and `inven`) to provide a structured and reusable dataset for analysis.
- **Inventory Management**: Integrated inventory data to track stock levels, damaged stock, and product details.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyzed customer feedback, ratings, and delivery performance to provide actionable insights.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **SQL**: For querying, cleaning, and transforming data.
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: Used to manage and query data from multiple tables.
- **Views**: Created reusable SQL views to simplify data access and reporting.
